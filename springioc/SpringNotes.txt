Spring

To make app configurable 

1 spring can create objects for the developer    
:  it create the classes into config file
2 and spiring can manage the objects 
 :  and the created object willl be stored inside the ioc container 
 	every object created inside the ioc container by spring is call as bean
3 it has the method call getBean("class name");
	we can pass the class name to it can be use to creat the object at runtime

their are 2 type of IOC container
	1 Bean factory(Interface) : it is backword in features 
	2 Application Context(Interface) : we have to use this because of advance features
		- for Application context we have 	class that is implemented call ClassPathXmlApplicationContext


Spring inversion control  : with the help of inversion control we are able to create diffrent type of class objectes 
	advantages :
		1 without inversion control we mannually have to cretae the object so with the help of this we are able to create the object dinamically 
 	
Q ) what is dependencies injection ?
	1 Setter injection
	2 constructor injetion
	
	in a class we have dependencies of two type 
		1. dependencies in form of literal type
		2. dependencies in form of objectives
		3. dependencies in form of collections
